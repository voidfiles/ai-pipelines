  "executive_summary": "Alex Kessinger (@voidfiles), with Jon Mitchell (@ablaze), Ben Friedland, Mark Thurman, Ben Ubois, Gabe Weatherhead, Brent Simmons, and Julien from Superfeedr wrote an essay prompted by Google Reader's July 1st closure (declining usage cited), arguing advertising economics have made websites nearly illegible while feed readers\u2014the best available tool for reclaiming context, pace, and flexibility\u2014risk extinction as CPM rates fall and no business model exists for free readers. Practical guidance on triage, the Canon folder, Pocket, and the five-phase information lifecycle is grounded through the Kuleshov Effect, a Sopranos/Wire structural analogy, and Frank Chimero's curation/collecting distinction from 'Sorting a Mass.' Jeff Weiner's Maslow's hierarchy argument at Yahoo ('a great idea never used') frames the central dilemma: innovation and total market expansion are impossible if every actor is purely trying to keep itself fed.",
  "core_thesis": "Feed readers are the best available tool for reclaiming context, pace, and flexibility from an advertising-degraded reading environment, but the ecosystem faces extinction unless the next wave of innovation following Google Reader's shutdown resolves its sustainability crisis.",
  "main_arguments": [
    "Google Reader closes July 1st (declining usage cited) while at least 3 large companies and 10+ smaller projects pursue the same market, indicating the market is in its infancy rather than terminal decline.",
    "Advertising economics have structurally degraded the website reading experience: publishers do ever more advertising against ever less original material stretched into ever more, thinner, smaller chunks, making the status quo for websites almost illegible while post volume becomes overwhelming.",
    "Feed readers provide three core benefits: context control (determining the aesthetic and ideological reading context, not ceding it to publishers), pace and efficiency (the user alone decides what to skip and what to spend time understanding), and flexibility (the user decides when, where, and how to read).",
    "Context is the most basic reason to use a feed reader: websites place content in a context of their choosing\u2014in the worst cases designing for maximum page views rather than efficient consumption\u2014whereas a feed reader lets a user put the Daily Kos next to the Weekly Standard in ways no editor would naturally do.",
    "The Kuleshov Effect\u2014whereby juxtaposition of shots causes the brain to create connections between disparate images and read expressions not explicitly shown\u2014explains feed reader value: feed readers splice together information streams like film editing, and juxtaposition is used and mis-used daily by media without anyone noticing.",
    "The Sopranos (one of the biggest shows of the last 20 years, objectively more honors including Emmys) represents the focused news diet with a strong central editorial thread, while The Wire (not a single Emmy, yet a small but vocal crowd consider it the best TV show ever made) represents the diffuse feed reader diet of 100+ feeds mixing professional, pro-am, and amateur voices\u2014David Simon's remark that he has 'a knack for making shows that people watch only after they have been on TV' supporting the conclusion that feed readers are 'an idea whose time is coming' and may not have seen their best days.",
    "Chris Wetherell stated 'a feed reader's interface might have to be athletically flexible to match a wide variety of reading styles,' and that Google's size, market dominance, routine user studies, and follow-up data support the assertion that feed reading styles have inherently different inflexibility compared with other software\u2014making flexibility of all kinds a basic tenet of feed readers.",
    "Sync\u2014making everything the same in multiple places\u2014is the technical cornerstone of the feed reader tool: information is created at breakneck speeds and must be manageable from anywhere; until the world has an ansible, breaks in connectivity must be addressed; offline should be the baseline with additional sync mechanisms layered on top; and one type of sync does not preclude another.",
    "Discovery is woefully underserved: feeds have a natural rate of decay or entropy requiring continuous subscription at a slightly faster rate than decay; Facebook's algorithm is most likely convergent and rarely if ever surprises users; discovery tools should support following sources, people, and possibly tags\u2014including author-level subscriptions like Mat Honan's at Wired over subscribing to all Wired stories, tastestalking, and following anyone referenced in your current stream (a positive signal)\u2014though following sources requires a ton of manual labour.",
    "The modern information lifecycle\u2014discovery, consumption, processing, review, internalizing\u2014replaces thesis-antithesis-synthesis: triage (feeds into folders with priority levels) is key to high-throughput reading; the Canon folder holds sites to read daily and every item within, grows slowest, and takes ~20 minutes; Pocket handles longer pieces feed readers aren't ideal for; the keeper pile holds items for future reference; and deliberate sharing with a comment\u2014not a plain link or a 'Like'\u2014is a strong curation signal.",
    "Frank Chimero's 'Sorting a Mass' supplies the key distinction: curation is about illumination (having selected items come to a point), while collecting is about propagation (growing in quantity and diversity); Jason Kottke spent almost a decade unpaid learning how to find good stuff online; curators shovel through content daily to find the best bits without creating primary sources; and half the battle is learning how not to care about all the information\u2014feeds never end, the only goal is to build a better net.",
    "Apple's post-Forstall organizational structure treats hardware and software not as two different things but as a single thing: design; in hardware, design is limited by physics (weight, density, size, connections, seams), software has no such limits, and iOS 6 took advantage of that to its detriment; Jony Ive can lead a software team, evidenced by 'a deep intellectual rigor to the design of iOS 7'; and separating feed reader interfaces from their back ends would allow hobby projects and experimentation without requiring a full back end build.",
    "The ecosystem faces an existential sustainability crisis: CPM rates have nowhere to go but down, most people have been trained not to pay for feed readers, no demonstrated business model exists for free readers, and no one can show any way to make money from a free feed reader\u2014if publishers and tool makers cannot be paid there will be no ecosystem left to defend, requiring them to work together to sustain and even fund the value; Jeff Weiner's Maslow's hierarchy argument at Yahoo ('a great idea never used') shows that if everyone is purely trying to keep themselves fed, innovation and total market expansion are impossible."

  "key_evidence": [
    "Chris Wetherell stated 'a feed reader's interface might have to be athletically flexible to match a wide variety of reading styles,' supported by Google's size, market dominance, routine user studies, and follow-up data showing feed reading styles have inherently different inflexibility compared with other software.",
    "The Sopranos 'objectively won more honors' including Emmys and is 'one of the biggest shows of the last 20 years'; The Wire 'didn't get a single Emmy' yet has 'a small but vocal crowd who think it may be the best TV show ever made.'",
    "David Simon said 'I have a knack for making shows that people watch only after they have been on TV'\u2014used to support the conclusion that feed readers are beginning to ripen and may not have seen their best days.",
    "Jason Kottke spent almost a decade, unpaid, learning how to find good stuff online\u2014cited as evidence of the depth of expertise required for genuine curation.",
    "Facebook's algorithm is most likely convergent\u2014it won't budge from what users have previously looked at and is rarely if ever going to surprise them\u2014contrasted with the divergent discovery capacity feed readers could provide.",
    "CPM rates have nowhere to go but down; most people have been trained not to pay for feed readers; there are free feed readers despite no demonstrated business model; and no one can show any way to make money from a free feed reader.",
    "Jeff Weiner, speaking at Yahoo, argued using Maslow's hierarchy of needs that Yahoo should reduce competing internal projects to concentrate on making Yahoo a great company\u2014described by Kessinger as 'a great idea never used.'",
    "The author identifies themselves as 'a slow reader (of words, not feeds)' who practices high-volume, fast-paced, modest-recall reading, including a de-duplication use case where scanning three or four takes on the same tech news announcement yields many different perspectives because each author understands the idea in a slightly different way.",
    "Pocket allows users to create a unified, ordered list of articles to read when they have time; the Canon folder grows slowest and typically takes 20 minutes to process.",
    "The Awl publishes firehose feeds for all their stories; Mat Honan writes for Wired; subscribing to an individual author feed like Mat Honan's provides more control than subscribing to all Wired stories, though following sources in general requires 'a ton of manual labour.'"
  ],
  "conclusions": [
    "With Google Reader's imminent shutdown, reading software must grow up: the old standard is going away and a new standard must be built, with Feedbin (Feedbin.me), Yoleo Reader, and Newsblur representing the emerging competitive field.",
    "Feed readers could be so powerful precisely because right now they are not; they are 'an idea whose time is coming' and may not have seen their best days, with the saving grace that people who use them use them heavily and don't want to lose them.",
    "If the next wave of innovation cannot fix sustainability problems\u2014no demonstrated business model for free readers, CPM rates with nowhere to go but down\u2014the ecosystem may face extinction; if publishers and tool makers cannot be paid, there will be no ecosystem left to defend.",
    "Jony Ive can lead a software team, evidenced by iOS 7's deep intellectual rigor and Apple's post-Forstall philosophy treating hardware and software not as two different things but as a single thing: design.",
    "Offline sync should be the baseline, with additional sync mechanisms layered on top; one type of sync does not preclude another; and the interface should be separable from the back end to allow hobby projects and experimentation without requiring a full back end build.",
    "Discovery is the most underserved feature category; feeds have a natural rate of entropy requiring continuous subscription at a slightly faster rate than decay, and discovery tools should support following sources, people, and possibly tags\u2014including author-level subscriptions and tastestalking\u2014to prevent gradual depletion of reading streams.",
    "The entire scope of the tool ecosystem must be considered or sight will be lost of what matters: the user; allowing for experimentation is the most important part of building a sustainable ecosystem, which may require tool makers and publishers to work together to sustain and even fund the value they create.",
    "Users should not feel guilty about not reading the millions of pieces of information that pile up every day; feeds and streams never end, the only goal is to build a better net, and the five-phase cycle\u2014discovery, consumption, processing, review, internalizing\u2014changes one's perception of the written world once internalized."
