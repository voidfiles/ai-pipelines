  "executive_summary": "Harwood, Keegan, Smith & Raine (Loughborough, Canberra, Bath) published this meta-analysis of 104 sport/PE studies (N=34,156) in Psychology of Sport & Exercise, 1990\u20132014. Hunter-Schmidt corrections within AGT (Nicholls, 1984/1989; Ames, 1992b) showed PTMC yields 24 adaptive correlates (4 large) versus PEPC's 15 maladaptive correlates with no large effects. Cross-sectional questionnaires, coach/youth/team-sport sampling, and only 15% behavioral data severely constrain causal inference.",
  "core_thesis": "PTMC predicts adaptive intrapersonal outcomes and PEPC maladaptive ones, but cross-sectional questionnaire dominance limits causal inference.",
  "main_arguments": [
    "AGT (Nicholls, 1984/1989) distinguishes task goals (self-referenced mastery) from ego goals (normative superiority), operating at state, contextual, and dispositional levels.",
    "Ames (1992b) established that subjective climate perception drives outcomes: PTMC items assess effort and learning; PEPC items assess rivalry, punishment, and unequal treatment.",
    "Goal orientation and situational climate interact to determine immediate goal involvement, with proposed mechanisms including socialization, gravitation, and cognitive bias (Harwood et al., 2008).",
    "PMCSQ-2 (Newton & Duda, 1993) dominated 38.5% of studies despite being team-sport-designed; teacher (LAPOPECQ, PECCS), coach (MCSYS), parent (PIMCQ-2), and peer (PeerMCYSQ) alternatives also exist.",
    "PTMC generated four large effect sizes: intrinsic motivation (\u03c1c=0.55, k=19), compound motivation/RAI (\u03c1c=0.51, k=8), IM-stimulation (\u03c1c=0.57, k=3), and perceived relatedness (\u03c1c=0.55, k=11).",
    "PEPC demonstrated moderate associations with ego-orientation (\u03c1c=0.36), external regulation (\u03c1c=0.34), amotivation (\u03c1c=0.40), antisocial attitudes (\u03c1c=0.33), and perfectionism (\u03c1c=0.49); no large effects.",
    "SDT (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Ryan & Deci, 2008; Vallerand & Fortier, 1998) complements AGT: PTMC predicts autonomous regulation; PEPC predicts external regulation and amotivation.",
    "Elliot & Church (1997) and Elliot & McGregor (2001)'s 2\u00d72 framework showed PTMC moderately linked to mastery-approach and PEPC moderately linked to performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals.",
    "Only 15% of correlates (k=80) addressed behaviour (42% heterogeneous); agent coverage was skewed: 59 coach studies vs. 5 peer (PeerMCYSQ) and 3 parent (PIMCQ-2), with only 3 examining multiple agents.",
    "Sample means concentrated at age 16.5 (77.8% under 20); only 4.8% examined elite athletes, 12.5% individual-sport contexts, and no study used random sampling.",
    "Correlation is insufficient for causality (Aldrich, 1995); 57 studies made practitioner recommendations from subjective perceptions, though Smith, Smoll & Cumming (2007) showed causal processes via interventions.",
    "Progress requires new explanatory theories beyond the potentially constraining task/ego binary\u2014including 'caring' and 'empowering' climate constructs\u2014per Kuhn (1962) and Popper (1969) standards."

  "key_evidence": [
    "Sample: 104 studies, 121 samples, N=34,156 (\u03c7=316.3, \u03c3=268.1); ages 10.0\u201338.2 years (\u03c7=16.5); 41.3% female, 52.6% male; 77.8% under age 20.",
    "Morris & Kavussanu (2008), Vazou et al. (2006), and White et al. (1998) were the only 3 of 104 studies examining concurrent perceptions of multiple social agents.",
    "PRISMA 2009 flow: 528 records identified; 104 included in qualitative and meta-analytic synthesis; inter-rater reliability 96.2% across 520 items.",
    "PE (32.7%) and team sports (32.7%) dominated; individual sports 12.5%; 4.8% examined elite athletes; only 2 studies sampled groups over age 30.",
    "Risk-of-bias: 93.3% valid climate measures; only 48.1% adjusted for covariates; 7.7% reported subscale correlations; no study used random sampling.",
    "PTMC: moderate associations with task-orientation (\u03c1c=0.46), self-esteem (\u03c1c=0.40), positive affect (\u03c1c=0.47), adaptive strategies (\u03c1c=0.47), and dispositional flow (\u03c1c=0.45).",
    "PEPC: moderate associations with perfectionism (\u03c1c=0.49, k=8, N=4,843), amotivation (\u03c1c=0.40), external regulation (\u03c1c=0.34), and negative relatedness (\u03c1c=\u22120.36).",
    "Instrument prevalence: PMCSQ-2 k=40 (38.5%), PMCSQ k=24 (23.1%), LAPOPECQ k=8 (7.7%), PeerMCYSQ k=5, PECCS k=5; MCSYS, PIMCQ-2, EPCM, TIMCQ each k=3.",
    "Behavioural effect sizes (k=80 of 525 total): 4 below 0.10, 6 small, 2 moderate, 0 large; 42% heterogeneous vs. 30% for cognitive-affective correlates."
  ],
  "conclusions": [
    "PTMC's 24 adaptive correlates (4 large) vs. PEPC's 15 maladaptive (0 large) replicates Ntoumanis & Biddle (1999) and Harwood et al. (2008).",
    "Behavioural correlates (15% of effect sizes, 42% heterogeneous) are severely under-examined, demanding longitudinal and experimental designs.",
    "Future research must examine multi-agent concurrent climates; conflicts between coach, parent, and peer messages remain entirely unstudied.",
    "Elite and adult athletes are critically underrepresented (4.8% elite; 2 studies over age 30), limiting applicability to high-performance contexts.",
    "New valid instruments are needed for individual sports; the dominant PMCSQ-2 and PeerMCYSQ were developed exclusively for team-sport populations.",
    "Objective climate instruments and analytic categories beyond the task/ego binary\u2014per Kuhn (1962) and Popper (1969)\u2014may unlock meaningful progress.",
    "Covariates\u2014age, gender, ethnicity\u2014must be standard controls; Harwood, Beauchamp & Keegan (2014) also require multilevel analysis of nested teams."
