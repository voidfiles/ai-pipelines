  "executive_summary": "Harwood (Loughborough), Keegan (Canberra), Smith, and Raine (Bath) meta-analyzed 104 published studies (N=34,156; 1990\u20132014) on intrapersonal correlates of perceived motivational climate in sport, using the Hunter-Schmidt method to organize findings into 17 correlate categories. Perceived Task/Mastery Climates (PTMC) showed large effects on intrinsic motivation (\u03c1c=0.55), relatedness (\u03c1c=0.55), and dispositional flow (\u03c1c=0.45); Perceived Ego/Performance Climates (PEPC) predicted external regulation, amotivation, perfectionism, and antisocial moral attitudes. Critical gaps include coach-centric sampling, demographic homogeneity (mean age 16.5 years), neglect of individual sports and behavioral outcomes, and near-exclusive reliance on cross-sectional correlational designs with higher-order climate perceptions.",
  "core_thesis": "Perceived task/mastery climates (PTMC) consistently predict adaptive intrapersonal outcomes in sport while ego/performance climates (PEPC) predict maladaptive ones, per a 104-study meta-analysis.",
  "main_arguments": [
    "Achievement Goal Theory (Nicholls, 1984/1989) distinguishes task goals (self-referenced mastery) from ego goals (normatively referenced competence) as the framework's conceptual foundation.",
    "Ames (1992) established that subjective perception of the motivational environment\u2014not objective coach/teacher behavior\u2014is the critical predictor of psychological and behavioral responses.",
    "PTMC themes are effort, learning/skill-improvement, cooperative learning, and mistakes-as-learning; PEPC themes are interpersonal rivalry, punishment for mistakes, unequal treatment, and achieving-without-effort.",
    "Elliot & McGregor (2001) extended the dichotomous AGT into a 2\u00d72 framework separating mastery-approach/avoidance and performance-approach/avoidance goal adoptions from dispositional orientations.",
    "Self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) complements AGT: PTMC predicts autonomous motivational regulation; PEPC predicts controlled regulation (external, introjected) and amotivation.",
    "PTMC associates with self-referenced perceived competence and global self-esteem; PEPC associates exclusively with norm-referenced competence evaluations.",
    "PTMCs show large positive effects on perceived relatedness (\u03c1c=0.55) and moderate effects on perceived autonomy (\u03c1c=0.32); PEPCs show negative associations with both psychological needs.",
    "PTMCs demonstrate large positive associations with intrinsic motivation (\u03c1c=0.55) and compound motivation (\u03c1c=0.51); PEPCs positively predict external regulation and amotivation with no association to IM.",
    "PTMC associates with pro-social moral attitudes and adaptive strategies; PEPC associates with antisocial attitudes, maladaptive strategies, and perfectionism, with no overlap.",
    "Behavioral correlates are severely underexamined: only 9.3% of identified correlates were behavioral, and 42% of behavioral effect sizes were heterogeneous versus 30% for cognitive/affective correlates.",
    "Coach-created climate dominates research (59 papers); parent-created (3 papers) and peer-created (5 papers) climates are severely underrepresented, leaving interactive multi-agent effects unresolved.",
    "Samples are demographically homogeneous\u2014mean age 16.5 years, 77.8% under 20\u2014with only 4.8% examining elite/professional athletes and only two studies including participants over 30.",
    "Individual sports constitute only 12.5% of samples, and PMCSQ-2, the dominant instrument (38.5% of studies), was developed for team sport populations without validated applicability to individual sports.",
    "Cross-sectional designs prevent causal inference; 57 studies (54.8%) made behavioral recommendations to coaches/teachers without objective behavioral measurements, which Keegan et al. (2010/2014b) critiqued.",
    "Only 7.7% of studies examined lower-order climate subscales, and none analyzed nested within-team effects or measured situational short-term climate perceptions rather than general contextual perceptions.",
    "Advancing the field requires new theoretical frameworks beyond the task/ego dichotomy\u2014invoking Kuhn (1962) and Popper (1969)\u2014alongside objective behavioral instruments being developed by Morgan & Kingston (2010) and Tessier et al. (2013)."

  "conclusions": [
    "PTMCs robustly predict intrinsic motivation, relatedness, flow, pro-social attitudes, adaptive strategies, and objective performance across 17 correlate categories.",
    "PEPCs predict external regulation, amotivation, perfectionism, antisocial moral attitudes, negative affect, and norm-referenced competence, with no large effect sizes identified.",
    "Future research must examine concurrent and interactive effects of coach, teacher, parent, and peer social agents simultaneously rather than in isolation.",
    "Objective behavioral measurement tools must supplement subjective questionnaires before behavioral recommendations to coaches, teachers, or parents can be empirically justified.",
    "Longitudinal and experimental designs are needed; correlational data cannot establish the directionality assumed by 57 studies that made coach/teacher behavioral recommendations.",
    "Sampling must extend to elite and adult athletes, individual sport performers, and populations spanning the full athletic career from youth to retirement.",
    "Situational, fine-grained climate measurement and lower-order subscale analysis should replace the near-exclusive focus on higher-order contextual climate perceptions.",
    "New explanatory theories beyond the task/ego dichotomy are needed to detect where, how, and why current AGT-based models fail, following Kuhn (1962) and Popper (1969)."
