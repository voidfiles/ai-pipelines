  "executive_summary": "Harwood (Loughborough), Keegan (Canberra), Smith (Bath), and Raine synthesised 104 studies (N=34,156) in Psychology of Sport and Exercise via Hunter\u2013Schmidt meta-analysis and PRISMA 2009. PTMCs yielded 24 adaptive intrapersonal associations with four large effects (intrinsic motivation, compound motivation, IM-stimulation, perceived relatedness); PEPCs yielded 15 maladaptive associations and no large effects. Behavioural correlates covered only 5 of 54 categories (15%), PMCSQ-2 lacks individual-sport validity, samples clustered at mean age 16.5, and designs were predominantly cross-sectional.",
  "core_thesis": "Harwood, Keegan, Smith, and Raine's PRISMA 2009-compliant Hunter\u2013Schmidt meta-analysis of 104 studies (N=34,156) in Psychology of Sport and Exercise confirms that Perceived Task-Mastery Climates (PTMCs) generate a broad, consistent, adaptive pattern of intrapersonal associations\u201424 correlates with four large effect sizes\u2014while Perceived Ego-Performance Climates (PEPCs) generate an opposing maladaptive profile across 15 correlates, though the field remains constrained by behavioural measurement deficits, team-sport instrument bias, social-agent imbalance, and demographic and design homogeneity.",
  "main_arguments": [
    "AGT (Nicholls, 1984/1989; Ames, 1992a/b; Duda, 1993; Blumenfeld, 1992) defines achievement behaviour as directed at developing or demonstrating high rather than low competence, distinguishes self-referenced task goals (mastery indicates competence) from norm-referenced ego goals (high competence demonstrated by achieving more than others with equal or less effort), and posits that participants' immediate goals are determined by the interaction between a stable goal orientation and the situational goal climate.",
    "PTMC encompasses five themes (effort, learning/skill-improvement, perceived important role, cooperative learning, mistakes-are-part-of-learning) and PEPC four themes (interpersonal comparison/rivalry, punishment/fear of mistakes, unequal treatment, achieving-without-effort); Ames asserted that the individual's subjective perception\u2014not objective characteristics\u2014predicts psychological and behavioural responses, while Nicholls (1989) acknowledged that objective contexts 'set the stage' without equating to subjective reality, so players sharing the same coach or teacher can hold substantially different climate perceptions (Papaioannou, 1994; Cumming et al., 2007).",
    "The review adhered to PRISMA 2009, drew on frameworks recommended by Higgins and Green (Cochrane Collaboration), Murtagh et al., Pope and Mays, Roen et al., Giacomini and Cook, Dixon-Woods et al., Pawson et al., Alderson and Green, and Sallis et al., adopted Hunter and Schmidt (2004) random-effects meta-analytic procedures with Cohen (1977) effect-size classifications (large: >0.50; moderate: 0.30\u20130.50; small: 0.10\u20130.30), and employed Maykut and Morehouse's (1994) Indwelling concept to guide qualitative analysis.",
    "The final sample comprised 104 studies (121 independent samples; N=34,156; \u03c7=316.3, \u03c3=268.1) spanning January 1990\u2013January 2014, with published mean ages 10.0\u201338.2 years (\u03c7=16.46, \u03c3=4.73; absolute limits 9\u201364 years; 77.8% under 20; 41.3% female, 52.6% male), drawn primarily from USA (k=33), UK (k=17), Spain (k=13), and Norway (k=11) plus 12 further countries including one cross-national study (Kristiansen, Roberts, and Abrahamsen, 2008), averaging 6.5 correlations per paper, and using PMCSQ-2 (k=40, 38.5%), PMCSQ (k=24), LAPOPECQ (k=8), PECCS and PeerMCYSQ (k=5 each), and PIMCQ-2, EPCM, TIMCQ (k=3 each) as primary instruments.",
    "Task orientation showed moderate positive and homogeneous PTMC associations (\u03c1c=0.46, CI=0.42\u20130.51; k=67, N=20,302) and ego orientation showed moderate positive PEPC associations (\u03c1c=0.36, CI=0.32\u20130.39; k=61, N=17,789) with no noteworthy cross-climate associations; in Elliot et al.'s 2\u00d72 framework, PTMC showed moderate positive associations with MApp goals (\u03c1c=0.47) and small positive associations with MAv and PApp goals (k=5; N=1,345), while PEPC showed moderate positive associations with both PApp (\u03c1c=0.38) and PAv (\u03c1c=0.36) goals and a small positive association with MAv goals (k=8; N=2,473), with three proposed mechanisms\u2014socialisation effect, gravitation effect, and goal orientations cognitively biasing climate perceptions.",
    "PTMC showed small positive associations with perceived competence overall (\u03c1c=0.24, CI=0.21\u20130.28; k=53, N=14,143) but moderate positive associations with self-referenced perceived competence specifically (\u03c1c=0.48, CI=0.38\u20130.58; k=3, N=1,979)\u2014consistent with theory that PTMC fosters competence because 'only winning is good enough' is not endorsed\u2014and with self-esteem/confidence (\u03c1c=0.40, CI=0.28\u20130.53; k=5, N=1,105) and objective performance (\u03c1c=0.25, CI=0.15\u20130.35; k=11, N=2,975), while PEPC showed no overall competence association (k=51, N=12,935) but a moderate positive association with norm-referenced perceived competence (\u03c1c=0.39) and a small negative association with self-esteem/confidence, with neither climate associated with physical self-perceptions (k=13, N=2,477) and PEPC showing no relationship with objective performance.",
    "Within the Self-Determination Theory framework (Deci and Ryan, 1985; Ryan and Deci, 2008; Vallerand, 1997; Vallerand and Fortier, 1998; Allen and Hodge, 2006; Duda, 2001; Ntoumanis, 2001), PTMC generated large positive associations with intrinsic motivation (\u03c1c=0.55; k=19, N=5,966), compound motivation (\u03c1c=0.51; k=58, N=2,296), IM-stimulation (\u03c1c=0.574), and perceived relatedness (\u03c1c=0.55; k=11, N=3,416), and moderate positive associations with IM-know (\u03c1c=0.482), IM-accomplish (\u03c1c=0.498), identified regulation (r=0.463), and perceived autonomy (\u03c1c=0.32; k=14, N=4,233), while PEPC generated no consistent intrinsic motivation pattern (k=17, N=4,896), moderate positive associations with external regulation (r=0.342; k=7, N=2,352) and amotivation (r=0.403; k=8, N=2,541), small negative associations with perceived autonomy (r=\u22120.181; k=13, N=3,725), and moderate negative associations with perceived relatedness (\u03c1c=\u22120.36; k=10, N=2,911), with Wang, Liu, Chatzisarantis, and Lim (2010) proposing that goal orientation moderates climate effects on affective states.",
    "PTMC showed moderate positive associations with positive affect (\u03c1c=0.47; k=39, N=9,746), adaptive strategies (\u03c1c=0.47; k=17, N=4,457), and dispositional flow (\u03c1c=0.45; k=6, N=3,858), small positive associations with pro-social moral functioning (\u03c1c=0.24; k=15, N=4,601) and attitudes/intentions (\u03c1c=0.27; k=27, N=6,646), and small negative associations with negative affect (\u03c1c=\u22120.17; k=34, N=7,334), negative thoughts/worries (\u03c1c=\u22120.19; k=17, N=2,285), maladaptive strategies (\u03c1c=\u22120.13; k=8, N=1,767), and antisocial moral functioning (\u03c1c=\u22120.23; k=11, N=3,980), while PEPC showed moderate positive associations with antisocial moral functioning (\u03c1c=0.33) and perfectionism (\u03c1c=0.49; k=8, N=4,843), small positive associations with negative affect and maladaptive strategies, small negative associations with positive affect, and no associations with pro-social moral functioning, dispositional flow, adaptive strategies, or age/experience (k=13, N=3,563).",
    "Only 5 of 54 correlate categories (k=80 of 525; 15%) addressed behaviour or behavioural intentions (objective performance, adaptive/maladaptive strategies, prosocial/antisocial moral functioning), and of 12 behavioural effect sizes four were below 0.1, six were small, and two were moderate\u2014none were large\u2014with 42% heterogeneous versus 30% of cognitive/affective correlates; pragmatic measurement difficulties and the theoretical emphasis on subjective meaning (Ames, 1992b; Treasure et al., 2001) partly explain this sparseness, while 57 studies (54.8%) made practitioner recommendations based on subjective climate perceptions alone, a practice critiqued by Keegan et al. (2010; 2014b) given that perceptions vary substantially within groups and correlation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for causality.",
    "Research focused overwhelmingly on coach-created (59 papers) and teacher-created (34 papers) climates, with only five papers examining peer-created climate and three examining parent-created climate, and only three concurrently examining all three agents; Duda (2001) identified the need to examine interactive effects of social agents thirteen years before this review without resolution, athletes may experience motivational 'pull and push' from multiple agents (Keegan, Harwood, Spray, and Lavallee, 2009; 2010a; 2010b; 2014a; 2014b), only two studies examined participants over 30 (Huddleston, Fry, and Brown, 2012; Kowal and Fortier), and only 4.8% of research examined adult national, international, and professional athletes.",
    "The PMCSQ-2 (k=40; 38.5%), developed from and for team sport populations, has been applied to individual sports performers without clear justification, and PeerMCYSQ (Ntoumanis and Vazou, 2005)\u2014the only recently developed peer-climate alternative\u2014was similarly developed for team sports; climate has been measured almost exclusively at a generalised contextual level, infrequently, using higher-order perceptions only (subscales examined in only 7.7% of papers), without nesting effects analyses, with questionnaire design minimising cross-loading even though interactivity may be central to real climate; Sproule et al. (2007) concluded that discrepancies between perceived and behaviourally measured climate structures require examination, while field-based experiments by Smith, Smoll, and Cumming (2007), Smoll, Smith, and Cumming (2007), and Standage, Treasure, Hooper, and Kuczka (2007) suggest causal connectedness between climate perceptions and motivational/emotional indices, and objective instruments being developed by Morgan and Kingston (2010) and Tessier et al. (2013) 'show promise.'",
    "No studies used random sampling; 94 (90.4%) provided adequate sample descriptions; 97 (93.3%) valid climate measurements; 88 (84.6%) valid correlate measurements; 50 (48.1%) adjusted for covariates; only 8 (7.7%) examined climate subscale correlations; inter-rater reliability reached 96.2% for 520 checked items; Chatzisarantis and Stoica (2009) stated inadequate reliability reporting 'should generally be discouraged to facilitate subsequent research syntheses'; the review excluded interpersonal correlates such as feelings towards coach/teacher, team cohesion, and parental pressure; and both Kuhn (1962, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) and Popper (1969, Conjectures and Refutations) held that the most substantial scientific progress comes from finding where, how, and why theories fail and where modifications are needed."

  "conclusions": [
    "Meta-analytic evidence broadly supports AGT and SDT predictions: PTMCs generate consistent positive adaptive associations across 24 intrapersonal correlates with four large effect sizes (intrinsic motivation, compound motivation, IM-stimulation, perceived relatedness), while PEPCs generate an opposing maladaptive profile across 15 correlates including moderate positive associations with external regulation, amotivation, and perfectionism and moderate negative associations with perceived relatedness, replicating the pattern reported by Ntoumanis and Biddle (1999) and Harwood, Spray, and Keegan (2008) and supporting the conclusion that 'considering the average-of-averages, those perceiving a task-mastery motivational climate engage in sport and physical activity more favourably.'",
    "The current body of research permits the conclusion that those perceiving a PTMC 'may think or feel more adaptively, but information regarding important behavioural outcomes is much less evidenced,' and to produce meaningful recommendations it 'may be necessary to introduce more ambitious and innovative measurement techniques,' with the objective instruments being developed by Morgan and Kingston (2010) and Tessier et al. (2013) 'showing promise' and field-based experiments by Smith, Smoll, and Cumming (2007), Smoll, Smith, and Cumming (2007), and Standage, Treasure, Hooper, and Kuczka (2007) suggesting causal connectedness between climate perceptions and motivational/emotional indices.",
    "Future research must examine the concurrent and interactive influences of multiple social agents\u2014coaches, teachers, peers, and parents\u2014on motivational climate, as athletes may experience motivational 'pull and push' from varying social agents; a need Duda (2001) identified thirteen years before this review without resolution; given that only five papers examined peer-created climate and three examined parent-created climate, with only three concurrently examining all three agents, this represents a major imbalance requiring targeted remediation.",
    "Future research should develop instrumentation grounded in individual sport settings rather than applying team-sport measures (PMCSQ-2, PeerMCYSQ) to individual athletes, should examine more situational and short-term climate perceptions rather than generalised contextual-level assessments, and may benefit from deploying analytic categories beyond the dichotomous task/ego framework, which may be 'unduly constraining' the field.",
    "Research samples have been demographically homogeneous\u2014concentrated around mean age 16.5 years (77.8% under 20), with only two studies examining groups over 30 (Huddleston, Fry, and Brown, 2012; Kowal and Fortier) and only 4.8% of research on adult national, international, and professional athletes\u2014necessitating expansion of age ranges and competitive levels, diversification beyond Physical Education and team sports to individual sports, and longitudinal designs to establish causal direction in climate\u2013outcome relationships.",
    "Drawing on Kuhn (1962, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, University of Chicago Press) and Popper (1969, Conjectures and Refutations, Routledge and Kegan Paul), the authors conclude that the most significant scientific advances come from finding where, how, and why theories fail, and thus future research should examine interpersonal correlates\u2014such as feelings towards coaches or teachers, team cohesion, and parental pressure\u2014explicitly excluded from the current review, developing evidence-based behavioural recommendations grounded in objectively verified, situationally sensitive measurements of motivational climate.",
    "Methodological quality requires adoption of random sampling (used by zero studies), systematic management of age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status covariates (controlled in only 50 of 104 studies), consistent reliability reporting above acceptable thresholds (inadequate practices critiqued by Chatzisarantis and Stoica, 2009), examination of lower-order climate subscales (only 7.7% of papers), analysis of nesting effects, and multilevel modelling, with the review itself reported in accordance with the PRISMA 2009 checklist (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, and The PRISMA Group, 2009; PLoS Med 6(6): e1000097; www.prisma-statement.org)."
