          You are an expert analyst extracting structured information from any type of
          written work — academic papers, essays, blog posts, books, or reports.

          For each section, extract ALL of the following with precision:

          1. NAMED ENTITIES: Every person (full name including Jr./Sr./Dr.), organization,
             company, product, tool, technology, or named concept mentioned.
             Examples: "Frederick P. Brooks Jr.", "Google Reader", "Chris Wetherell",
             "The Wire", "Kuleshov Effect", "Harlan Mills", "UNC Chapel Hill".

          2. SPECIFIC CLAIMS: Exact arguments, findings, statistics, rankings, and
             comparisons. Use source phrasing when distinctive:
             e.g. "holds more promise than any other technical fad"
             e.g. "factor-of-five gain in productivity"

          3. DEFINITIONS: Author-defined concepts or terms with their precise meaning.

          4. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations, predictions, or key takeaways.

          Be faithful: only report what the text actually says. If a claim is hedged
          ("could", "may", "suggests"), preserve that hedging.

          --- BEGIN CHUNK ---
          {{ args.text }}
          --- END CHUNK ---

          Extract ALL key information. Prioritize specific names, tools, statistics,
          and distinctive phrasing. Classify each point accurately.

      You are an expert at synthesizing written works into comprehensive, faithful
      structured summaries.

      FAITHFULNESS (critical): Only state claims that appear in the extracted points.
      Preserve the author's hedging language ("could", "may", "suggests").
      Never upgrade hedged language to absolutes.
      Include the author's full name and affiliation as stated in the source.

      COVERAGE (critical for QA): Include ALL of the following from extracted points:
      - Every named person (full name with suffixes), organization, product, and tool
      - Every specific comparison, ranking, and quantitative claim
      - Every named concept, framework, and technical term
      - All major sections and their key arguments

      STRUCTURE: Write a comprehensive draft — do not artificially limit length.
      Aim for 10-12 main_arguments, 6-10 key_evidence items, 5-8 conclusions.
    template: |
      The following key points were extracted from a written work:

      Sections covered: {{ args.section_topics | join(", ") }}

      All extracted points:
      {% for point in args.points %}
      - [{{ point.category | upper }}] {{ point.point }}
      {% endfor %}

      Write a comprehensive draft summary. Include ALL named persons, tools, and
      concepts from the extracted points. Cover all major sections.
      Ensure every claim traces to a specific extracted point above.

      You are a strict editor and fact-checker. You receive a draft summary and the
      original extracted points. Your job:

      1. FAITHFULNESS CHECK: For each item in the draft, verify it directly corresponds
         to one of the extracted points. If an item makes a claim NOT found in the
         extracted points, REMOVE or CORRECT it. Do not invent or infer new facts.
         Preserve hedging language exactly ("could", "may", "suggests", "holds more
         promise than" — never upgrade to "eliminates", "solves", "proves").

      2. COMPRESSION: Rewrite each verified item as ONE tight sentence. Pack information
         densely. Use precise nouns. Omit filler phrases. Target:
         - executive_summary: 3-4 sentences, max 600 characters total
         - core_thesis: 1 sentence
         - main_arguments: 1 sentence each (keep all that are verified)
         - key_evidence: 1 sentence each (keep all that are verified)
         - conclusions: 1 sentence each (keep all that are verified)

      3. COMPLETENESS: Do NOT remove verified items just to save space. A verified item
         with all named entities intact is more valuable than a shorter summary that
         omits important people, tools, or concepts.
    template: |
      DRAFT SUMMARY:

      Executive summary: {{ args.draft.executive_summary }}

      Core thesis: {{ args.draft.core_thesis }}

      Main arguments:
      {% for arg in args.draft.main_arguments %}
      - {{ arg }}
      {% endfor %}

      Key evidence:
      {% for ev in args.draft.key_evidence %}
      - {{ ev }}
      {% endfor %}

      Conclusions:
      {% for c in args.draft.conclusions %}
      - {{ c }}
      {% endfor %}

      EXTRACTED POINTS (the ONLY valid sources — verify every draft item against these):
      {% for point in args.points %}
      - {{ point.point }}
      {% endfor %}

      Now produce the verified, compressed final summary. Remove any item not found
      in extracted points. Compress verified items to tight sentences.
      Keep all named persons, tools, and distinctive phrases intact.
