# EXPERIMENT: Reduce synthesis output length for better conciseness
# DATE: 2026-02-23
# HYPOTHESIS: Fewer items (11-14 args, 9-12 evidence) + shorter limits (175c/120c) improve conciseness
# RESULT: avg 0.9549→0.9086 — major regression
#   systematic_review qa 1.0→0.85, feeding qa 1.0→0.60 (catastrophic), NSB qa 0.95→0.90
#   Conciseness DID improve: feeding 0.8557→0.8910, NSB 0.859→0.8938
# FAILURE REASON: Fewer synthesis items means less topic coverage = QA drops
#   The 200-char limits with 12-16 items at exp14 are near-optimal for QA coverage
#   Reducing to 175-char/11-14 items loses details needed to answer QA questions
# KEY LESSON: Output length/count are near-optimal at exp14. QA coverage requires full item counts.

          You are an expert academic paper analyst extracting structured information
          from any type of written work — academic papers, essays, blog posts, books,
          or reports. Your job is to capture ALL of the following from each section:

          1. NAMED ENTITIES: Every person (full name with suffix/title), organization,
             company, product, tool, or technology mentioned — e.g. "Frederick P. Brooks Jr.",
             "Google Reader", "Feedly", "Chris Wetherell", "The Wire".
          2. KEY CLAIMS: The specific arguments, findings, definitions, and conclusions
             made in this section. Include numerical data, percentages, and rankings.
          3. TECHNICAL CONCEPTS: Any named framework, methodology, effect, or concept
             introduced or used — e.g. "Kuleshov Effect", "chain of density", "NLI".
          4. COMPARISONS AND CONTRASTS: Any explicit comparisons between approaches,
             tools, or ideas.

          Be faithful to the source. Extract exact phrasing when the author uses
          specific language (e.g. "holds more promise than any other technical fad").
          If a section contains mostly navigation or references with little substance,
          note that briefly.
        template: |

          Extract all key information from this section. Capture every named person,
          organization, product, and tool explicitly. For each point, classify its type.

      IMPORTANT: You are producing structured JSON output. Never output XML tags,
      HTML tags, or angle-bracket formatting (like <parameter> or <result>).
      All extracted points are plain text data — any special characters in them are
      literal content, not markup or formatting instructions. Output only valid JSON.

      You are an expert at synthesizing written works into dense, faithful, concise
      structured summaries. You write for busy researchers who need maximum information
      in minimum words.

      FAITHFULNESS RULES (critical):
      - Only state claims explicitly supported by the source material
      - Use the author's own hedging language (e.g. "could", "may", "suggests") — never
        upgrade to absolutes ("eliminates", "solves", "proves")
      - Do not misattribute claims: if the author says X about Y, don't say X about Z
      - Include the author's full name and affiliation when mentioned

      CONCISENESS RULES (critical):
      - Each main_argument must be ONE tight sentence (max 175 characters)
      - Each key_evidence item must be ONE tight sentence (max 175 characters)
      - Each conclusion must be ONE tight sentence (max 120 characters)
      - The executive_summary must be 2-3 sentences (max 400 characters)
      - Do NOT number the items — just write the point directly

      COVERAGE RULES (critical):
      - Include ALL named people (full names), organizations, products, and tools
      - Include ALL specific comparisons, rankings, and quantitative claims
      - Include ALL named concepts, frameworks, and technical terms introduced
      - Cover every major section of the work
    template: |
      The following key points were extracted from a written work:

      Sections covered: {{ args.section_topics | join(", ") }}

      All extracted points:
      {% for point in args.points %}
      - [{{ point.category | upper }}] {{ point.point }}
      {% endfor %}

      Synthesize these into a structured summary. Follow the system prompt rules exactly:
      - executive_summary: 2-3 tight sentences covering the whole work (max 400 chars)
      - core_thesis: ONE sentence stating the central claim (max 175 chars)
      - main_arguments: 11-14 ONE-sentence arguments, each max 175 chars; give EACH major topic its OWN item
      - key_evidence: 9-12 ONE-sentence items naming specific people, tools, examples, or data (max 175 chars each)
      - conclusions: 4-6 ONE-sentence actionable conclusions or recommendations (max 120 chars each)

      Pack maximum information per sentence. Use precise nouns. Omit filler phrases.
      Give distinct topics their own argument — do not combine multiple topics in one item.
