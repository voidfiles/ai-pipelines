  "executive_summary": "Frederick P. Brooks Jr. (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) argues in \"No Silver Bullet\" that no single development in technology or management promises even one order-of-magnitude improvement within a decade in software productivity, reliability, or simplicity, because software's four essential difficulties\u2014complexity, conformity, changeability, and invisibility\u2014are irreducible by any technical attack. Past gains from high-level languages, time-sharing, and unified environments (Unix, Interlisp) removed accidental, not essential, barriers; since accidental tasks cannot plausibly consume nine-tenths of all effort, eliminating them entirely cannot yield the needed gain. Brooks surveys Ada, object-oriented programming, expert systems, automatic programming, graphical programming, program verification, and improved environments, finding none capable of breakthrough productivity. Four promising but non-magical approaches are identified: buying off-the-shelf software, rapid prototyping for requirements elicitation, Harlan Mills's incremental organic development, and systematically cultivating great designers.",
  "core_thesis": "There is no single development\u2014in technology or management technique\u2014that by itself promises even one order-of-magnitude improvement within a decade in software productivity, reliability, or simplicity, because software's essential difficulties are irreducible.",
  "main_arguments": [
    "Software construction divides into essential tasks (fashioning complex conceptual structures) and accidental tasks (representation in programming languages, mapping onto machine languages); most big past gains came from removing accidental barriers such as severe hardware constraints and awkward languages. Unless accidental tasks consume more than nine-tenths of all effort, shrinking every accidental activity to zero cannot yield an order-of-magnitude gain\u2014and the hard part remains specification, design, and testing of the conceptual construct, not labor of representation.",
    "The four essential properties of software are irreducible: complexity (no two parts alike above statement level, nonlinear interactions, orders of magnitude more states than computers); conformity (arbitrary interfaces designed by different people\u2014not by necessity\u2014to which software must conform); changeability (software embodies function, the part most subject to pressure, and is infinitely malleable, so all successful software gets changed); and invisibility (no geometric representation\u2014software structure comprises several non-planar directed graphs superimposed on one another, impeding both individual design and communication).",
    "Ada embodies features encouraging modern design, modularization, abstract data types, and hierarchical structuring, and its philosophy is more of an advance than the language itself; but Ada is just another high-level language, and the biggest payoff from such languages came from the first transition up from machine complexity\u2014diminishing returns apply thereafter. Brooks predicts Ada's greatest contribution will be training programmers in modern software design techniques, not any particular language feature.",
    "Object-oriented programming\u2014specifically abstract data types and hierarchical types as in Simula-67, which are orthogonal concepts\u2014holds more promise than any other technical fad of the day, and Brooks declares himself among those believers; however, each OOP advance removes only accidental complexity, leaving essential design complexity untouched. An order-of-magnitude gain from OOP would require that unnecessary type-specification underbrush accounts for nine-tenths of all design work\u2014a claim Brooks doubts.",
    "Expert systems (AI-2), whose power comes from ever-richer knowledge bases rather than fancier inference mechanisms (per Edward Feigenbaum), offer the most promising AI application to software development: advising on interface rules, testing strategies, bug-type frequencies, and optimization hints, and\u2014most importantly\u2014putting accumulated wisdom of the best programmers at the service of inexperienced ones. The gap between best and average software engineering practice is very wide, perhaps wider than in any other engineering discipline, making this leverage substantial.",
    "Three further technical candidates fail as silver bullets: automatic programming is a euphemism for programming with a higher-level language than presently available, and Parnas notes the term is used for glamour rather than semantic content; graphical programming is fundamentally misleading because software is not a layered two-dimensional object like a VLSI chip and screens are too small in pixels to show both scope and resolution of serious diagrams; and program verification, though powerful for secure OS kernels, cannot eliminate testing\u2014even a perfect proof only establishes that a program meets its specification, not that the specification itself is correct.",
    "The most radical productivity solution is not to construct software at all but to buy it: any purchased product at $100,000 cost equals roughly one programmer-year, delivers immediately, and is better documented and maintained than homegrown software. The shift from $2-million machines in 1960 (where $250,000 custom payroll programs were affordable) to $50,000 office machines (where they are not) drives the mass-market trend, which Brooks calls the most profound long-run trend in software engineering; electronic spreadsheets and simple database systems are dramatic examples.",
    "The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build: clients cannot know what they want in sufficient detail before trying versions of the product, making the assumption that a satisfactory system can be fully specified in advance fundamentally wrong. Rapid prototyping\u2014simulating important interfaces and main functions without hardware or cost constraints\u2014attacks the essence of the software problem and is among the most promising current technological efforts, because the most important function software builders perform for clients is iterative extraction and refinement of requirements.",
    "Harlan Mills's incremental development\u2014growing a system top-down by first running a skeleton of dummy subprograms and fleshing it out bit by bit\u2014so radically changed Brooks's own practice and effectiveness that nothing in the past decade compares; teams can grow much more complex entities in four months than they can build, and the approach enables easy backtracking, early prototypes, and always having a working system. The approach also requires top-down design, lends itself to organic function growth, and addresses the argument that the building metaphor for software has outlived its usefulness."

  "key_evidence": [
    "High-level languages provided at least a factor-of-five gain in productivity with concomitant gains in reliability, simplicity, and comprehensibility\u2014the most impactful single accidental-complexity removal.",
    "Unix and Interlisp, the first integrated programming environments in widespread use, are perceived to have improved productivity by integral factors; time-sharing brought major improvement, though smaller than high-level languages.",
    "No other technology since civilization began has seen six orders of magnitude price-performance gain in 30 years (hardware), flowing from transformation of computer manufacture from an assembly industry into a process industry.",
    "Study after study shows the very best designers produce structures that are faster, smaller, simpler, cleaner, and produced with less effort\u2014the differences between great and average approach an order of magnitude (Software Engineering Institute research cited).",
    "Edward Feigenbaum's finding: the power of expert systems comes not from ever-fancier inference mechanisms but from ever-richer knowledge bases that reflect the real world more accurately.",
    "Nothing in Brooks's past decade so radically changed his own practice or its effectiveness as Harlan Mills's incremental top-down development; teams can grow much more complex entities in four months than they can build.",
    "During the 1950s\u201360s, study after study showed users would not use off-the-shelf packages for payroll, inventory, and accounts receivable; by the 1980s such packages are in high demand, driven by the fall from $2-million to $50,000 machines making $250,000 custom programs unaffordable."
  ],
  "conclusions": [
    "The four most promising attacks on the software problem are: exploiting the mass market to buy rather than build; using rapid prototyping to establish requirements iteratively; growing software organically via Harlan Mills's incremental top-down development; and identifying and developing great designers\u2014none is a silver bullet, but disciplined consistent effort should yield an order-of-magnitude improvement, and there is no royal road but there is a road.",
    "The most powerful near-term contribution of expert systems will be to put the experience and accumulated wisdom of the best programmers at the service of inexperienced ones, given the very wide gap between best and average practice\u2014wider than in perhaps any other engineering discipline.",
    "The assumption that a satisfactory software system can be fully specified in advance, bids obtained, and the result installed is fundamentally wrong; the most important function software builders perform for clients is iterative extraction and refinement of requirements, and many software acquisition problems spring directly from this fallacy.",
    "Great designers are as important to an organization's success as great managers and must be equally nurtured and rewarded: organizations should systematically identify top designers as early as possible (the best are often not the most experienced), assign career mentors, maintain career development plans with apprenticeships under top designers, advanced formal education, and technical leadership assignments, and provide fully equivalent perquisites of recognition.",
    "Brooks's skepticism about silver bullets is explicitly not pessimism: although no startling breakthroughs are in view, the central question of how to improve the software art centers, as always, on people\u2014and the most important single effort any organization can mount is to develop ways to grow great designers.",
    "The most radical single software productivity strategy for many organizations today is to equip computer-na\u00efve intellectual workers with personal computers and good generalized writing, drawing, file, and spreadsheet programs and turn them loose\u2014avoiding construction entirely where mass-market products suffice."
